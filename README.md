#### A beer keg application.

#### By _Anousone Kaseumsouk, Lan Dam, Jean Jia, 08.15.2018_

## Description

Tap Room is an application that allows a user to view a list of beer and add and edit its contents. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Specification

* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).

* As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)
As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.

* As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints).

* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.

* As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.

* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.

* As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
